      <h3>History of Kazakhstan</h3>
      <p>
        The history of Kazakhstan spans thousands of years,
        beginning with the ancient Sakas and Turkic Khaganates, 
        through its incorporation into the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union,
        and ending with its independence on December 16, 1991.
        The key moments were the formation of the Turkic states,
        the era of the Great Steppes, the tragic periods of famine and repression during the Soviet period,
        and then the independent development of the country under the leadership of the first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev,
        and then Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.

      <h3>Culture</h3>
      <p>
       The culture of Kazakhstan is a rich synthesis of nomadic traditions,
       Islam and European influences, formed on the basis of the country's centuries—old history and multinational composition.
       It includes unique arts, customs such as the yurt as a dwelling, the dombra as a musical instrument, 
       and literary works such as the poem "Kyz-Zhibek." Modern Kazakh culture strives to preserve linguistic diversity
       and takes care of its cultural roots.
